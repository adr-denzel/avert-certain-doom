# AvertCertainDoom

Project using variables, various data types, if statements, loops and nested structures.

A simple game. I applied my knowledge to a new technology and environment, and taught myself to adapt to working with a codebase I did not write. I also got to experiment with an all new library Pygame!

Anyway, avoid the sprites to avert certain doom!
