# PyGameDemo

Project using variables, various data types, if statements, loops and nested structures.

I created a simple game with Pygame. I wanted to apply my knowledge to new technologies and environments, and teach myself to adapt to work with code libraries that are novel to me. I also wanted to my ability to understand and modify code that someone else has written.

Anyway, avoid the sprites to avert certain doom!
